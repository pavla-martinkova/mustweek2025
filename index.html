## Introduction

- Information and library studies graduate
- doctoral student at Charles University in Information science
- library open science methodologist
- project data steward and open science manager

---

## Humanities researchers often struggle with conceptualising their material as 'data'

--

**Diverse and unstructured**
- Humanities data exists in heterogeneous formats (texts, images, audio recordings) often lacking traditional structure.

--

**Qualitative and interpretive**
- Data frequently requires subjective interpretation and qualitative analysis.

--

**Ethical complexities**
- Research often involves navigating GDPR regulations and copyright concerns.

--

**Growing data literacy needs**
- Increasing demand for data management skills may be difficult to adapt for some researchers.

---

## Challenges in adhering to FAIR principles in humanities research

**Findable**
- Challenge: Creating meaningful metadata for unstructured or interpretive material.

--

**Accessible**
- Challenge: Balancing open access with ethical restrictions on sensitive interview data or copyrighted material.

--

**Interoperable**
- Challenge: Establishing standards for unique material.

--

**Reusable**
- Challenge: Documenting context and interpretive frameworks for meaningful reuse

---

## Libraries as RDM support

1. DMP guidance and review
2. Assistance with repository selection and navigating depository procedures
3. Training and workshops on data literacy and tools
4. Support with creating metadata and documentation
5. Legal and ethical guidance .footnote[.bold[*]]

## Czech funding agencies

- inspired by Horizon EU
- 

---

## Czech Data Stewards Community

- part of the [EOSC-CZ](https://www.eosc.cz/en/communities/data-stewards) ecosystem
- Discord server for sharing best practices and seeking advice
- Monthly online meetings
- Various learning opportunities (guides, workshops, summer school, ...)
- Promotion of data stewardship (map, contact list, campaigns, ...)

---

## Case studies



---

## Data stewardship toolkit



---

## Next steps?

- Ongoing skills development for both researchers and data stewards
- Strengthening connections between libraries and researchers
- Developing tools and repositories tailored to humanities research needs
- Establishing data management as one of the fundamental components of humanities research
