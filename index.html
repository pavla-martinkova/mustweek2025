## Humanities researchers may struggle with conceptualising their material as ‚Äòdata‚Äô.

---

## Nature of data in the humanities

--

**Diverse and unstructured**
- Humanities data exists in heterogeneous formats (texts, images, audio recordings, ...) often lacking inherent structure.

--

**Qualitative and interpretive**
- Data may require subjective interpretation and qualitative analysis.

--

**Ethical complexities**
- Research often involves navigating GDPR regulations and copyright and legal concerns.

--

**Growing data literacy needs**
- Increasing demand for data management skills may be difficult to adapt for some researchers.

--

üëÄ [Examples from our faculty](https://digital-humanities.phil.muni.cz/en/research-and-projects/catalogue-of-platforms-at-muni-arts)

## Challenges in adhering to FAIR principles in humanities research

--

**Findable**
- Challenge: Creating meaningful metadata for unstructured or interpretive material.

--

**Accessible**
- Challenge: Balancing open access with ethical restrictions on sensitive interview data or copyrighted material.

--

**Interoperable**
- Challenge: Establishing standards for unique material.

--

**Reusable**
- Challenge: Documenting context and interpretive frameworks for meaningful reuse

---

## ü§ù Libraries as RDM support 

1. DMP guidance and review
2. Grant application drafts review
3. Assistance with repository selection and navigating depository procedures
4. Training and workshops on data literacy and tools
5. Support with creating metadata and documentation
6. Legal and ethical guidance .footnote[.bold[*]]
7. And more?

.footnote[.bold[*] Forward to specialised departments]

## Three ‚Äòcase studies‚Äô

---

## 1) But I have no data üò®

--

Yes you do! Scans, photographs, field notes, ... 

--

Assist with selecting a suitable journal to budget for APCs.

Offer a checklist of areas to consider in the application (example follows).

**Useful tools**
- [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk)

## 2) I need to write a DMP... and it‚Äòs a massive waste of my time üòí

Offer assistance and review.

--

**Useful tools**
- [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://dsw.muni.cz/wizard/)
- [DMP online](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)
- MS Word (it happens)

---

## 3) I need to store/publish my data üíæ

Help navigate to a safe and suitable solution. 

--

**Useful tools**
- [University recommendations](https://it.muni.cz/en/overviews/recommendations-for-the-usage-of-storages)
- [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)
- Repository selection sheet for the humanities, to be published **soon** on library website

---

## What‚Äòs next?

‚û°  Ongoing skills development for both researchers and data stewards.

‚û°  Strengthening connections between libraries and researchers.

‚û°  Developing tools and repositories tailored to humanities research needs.

‚û°  Establishing data management as one of the fundamental components of humanities research.
