## Humanities researchers often struggle with conceptualising their material as 'data'

---

## Nature of data in humanities

--

**Diverse and unstructured**
- Humanities data exists in heterogeneous formats (texts, images, audio recordings) often lacking traditional structure.

--

**Qualitative and interpretive**
- Data frequently requires subjective interpretation and qualitative analysis.

--

**Ethical complexities**
- Research often involves navigating GDPR regulations and copyright concerns.

--

**Growing data literacy needs**
- Increasing demand for data management skills may be difficult to adapt for some researchers.

---

## Challenges in adhering to FAIR principles in humanities research

--

**Findable**
- Challenge: Creating meaningful metadata for unstructured or interpretive material.

--

**Accessible**
- Challenge: Balancing open access with ethical restrictions on sensitive interview data or copyrighted material.

--

**Interoperable**
- Challenge: Establishing standards for unique material.

--

**Reusable**
- Challenge: Documenting context and interpretive frameworks for meaningful reuse

---

## Libraries as RDM support

1. DMP guidance and review
2. Assistance with repository selection and navigating depository procedures
3. Training and workshops on data literacy and tools
4. Support with creating metadata and documentation
5. Legal and ethical guidance .footnote[.bold[*]]
